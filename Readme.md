This Github page is a part of **Estimation Theory EE2102523** 
by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul*.

Our goal is to provide the code-based visualization and exercises to understand the mathematics behind each of the lecture.
 

## Topics

I hope that at the end, I will be able to provide the coding scripts & excercises for the following topics

- [x] [Tutorial 1](Tutorial1/main.ipynb) to support Lecture I 
    - Sampling from distirbution
    - Example of estimators (sample mean/sample variances)
    - Estimator properties (bias, mse, consistency). 
    - Homework Simulation
 
- [x] [Tutorial 2](Tutorial2/main.ipynb): to support Lecture II
    - Convergence in distribution, 
    - Central limit Theorems, 
    - KL divergence, 
    - Convergence in probability, 
    - Almost sure Convergence simulation. 
    - Homework Simulation

- [ ] Tutorial 3: ML Esitmation, KL-Divergence minimizatoin, MAP Esitmation. This provides the use cases for Lecture 3-6.   
 

## Getting Started

1. Change the directory to the `Tutorial` folder.
2. Look for the  instructions (e.g. [Tutorial 1 Readme](Tutorial1/Readme.md)) for install dependencies. 
3. You may execute the `main` file in python or ipynb fileformat. 

* Course materials (such as HW and lecture notes) maybe provided in each `Tutorial` folder. 
* Each tutorial runs independently in its own environment.
