This site is parts of Estimation Theory EE2102523 
by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul*.

`Goal`: to provide the code-based visualization and exercises to understand the mathematics behind each of the lecture.
 

## Topics

I hope that at the end, I will be able to provide the coding scripts & excercises for the following topics

- [x] [Tutorial 1](Tutorial1/main.ipynb): Sampling from distirbution, example of estimators (sample mean/sample variances), estimator properties (bias, mse, consistency). This support Lecture 1 in Estimation Theory EE2102523 
 
- [ ] Tutorial 2: Convergence in distribution, Central limit Theorems, Weak/Strong law of large number. This supports parts of Lecture 2. 

- [ ] Tutorial 3: ML Esitmation, KL-Divergence minimizatoin, MAP Esitmation. This provides the use cases for Lecture 3-6.   
 

## Getting Started

1. Change the directory to the `Tutorial` folder.
2. Look for the  instructions (e.g. [Tutorial 1 Readme](Tutorial1/Tutorial1_Readme.md)) for install dependencies. 
3. You may execute the `main` file in python or ipynb fileformat. 

* Course materials (such as HW and lecture notes) maybe provided in each `Tutorial` folder. 
* Each tutorial runs independently in its own environment.
