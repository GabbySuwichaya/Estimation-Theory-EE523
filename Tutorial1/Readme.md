## Tutorial 1: What is an estimator? 

by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Ph.D.*

The lecture handout for [`Lecture I: What is an estimator? and Homework](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VAEFqNYpjVlbc7dac92entSJlO_gzd-6?usp=drive_link) are attached in Google drive.



Let's start 

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GabbySuwichaya/Estimation-Theory-EE523/blob/master/Tutorial1/main.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

or you can run `main.ipynb` locally for the coding exercies and examples used as parts of `Lecture I: What is Estimator?` 

The topics covered in the colab page and `main.ipynb`  are: 

- [Sampling from Distribution](#sampling-from-distribution)
- [Estimators](#estimators) 
    - [Sample Mean](#sample-mean-estimator)
    - [Sample Variance](#sample-variance-estimator)
- [Estimator Properties](#estimator-properties)
    - [Bianess](#biasness)
    - [MSE](#mse)
    - [Consistency](#consistency)
- [HW1.2](#hw12) see [Homework I](hw1.pdf)
    - [Biased Estimator](#biased-estimator)
    - [Unbiased Estimator](#unbiased-estimator)
     
### Quick start 

You can try it locally ... Just install dependenies listed in `requirements.txt` by 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the jupyternote book [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb).
 

 
### Final Notes.
-  The coding examples of sampling, biased, and unbiased estimation are adopted from [Sampling \& Estimation EP.3 by Khalel Corona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNbDigYLqSY).
-  Don't forget to install the dependency `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `utils.py` contains the supplenmary implementations for each fucntion used in `main.ipynb` 
- Good luck!
