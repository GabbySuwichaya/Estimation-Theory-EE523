## Tutorial 1: What is an estimator? 

by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Ph.D.*

The lecture handout for [`Lecture I: What is an estimator?` ](lecture1.pdf) and [Homework](hw1.pdf) are attached in this folder.

`main.ipynb` contains the coding exercies and examples used as parts of `Lecture I`. 

The topics covered in `main.ipynb` are: 

- [Sampling from Distribution](#sampling-from-distribution)
- [Estimators](#estimators) 
    - [Sample Mean](#sample-mean-estimator)
    - [Sample Variance](#sample-variance-estimator)
- [Estimator Properties](#estimator-properties)
    - [Bianess](#biasness)
    - [MSE](#mse)
    - [Consistency](#consistency)
- [HW1.2](#hw12) see [Homework I](hw1.pdf)
    - [Biased Estimator](#biased-estimator)
    - [Unbiased Estimator](#unbiased-estimator)
     
### Quick start 


Install dependenies listed in `requirements.txt` by 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the jupyternote book [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb).
 

 
### Final Notes.
-  The coding examples of sampling, biased, and unbiased estimation are adopted from [Sampling \& Estimation EP.3 by Khalel Corona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNbDigYLqSY).
-  Don't forget to install the dependency `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `utils.py` contains the supplenmary implementations for each fucntion used in `Lecture1.ipynb` 
- Good luck!
