Please follow the following steps, so that I can check if the system is working fine for the actual grading. 

- Please implement your work in the provided `.ipynb` file.  

- Once you finished, put the current folder that contains your `.ipynb` file into a new folder that has  your student id  as the folder name. 

For example,  `6470160121/Coding/Step0_Testing.ipynb`

- When you finished, please zip the folder (`6470160121.zip`) and submit it via [MSTeam](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/school/FileBrowserTabApp/General?groupId=2d8dd0eb-8fac-4cdb-8dd7-d70a1e9ab3b4&threadId=19:KkkpzATb2QVQXJ7M_IP5WYUzIkOVGtQLC2BX0QROmd01@thread.tacv2&ctx=channel) into `Testing_NotebookGrading` folder.
